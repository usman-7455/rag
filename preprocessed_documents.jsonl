He was sitting in a chair waiting for his wife to get ready, they were going to a block party. The pain then continued with intermittent worsening for 'hours,' no exacerbation with movement.

The pressure and pain returned yesterday while patient was sitting and doing work on his Ipad. He then got up and walked on a treadmill - to his surprise, the pain soon subsided. He has not taken any SL nitro at home. Given his recurrent symptoms, patient called his cardiologist who referred him to the ED.

She reports that her BP was more elevated than usual this morning and kept increasing despite her taking multiple doses of Losartan, reaching the 200s in the evening. She felt somewhat lightheaded and developed pain in the left side of her chest and neck. She denied any headache, vision changes, hearing changes, muscle weakness, facial droop, difficulty speaking, or new paresthesias. She was concerned that her elevated BP might cause a stroke and impact her ability to live by herself. She has recently been treated with Macrobid for a UTI, and still has some suprapubic discomfort. She has been drinking lots of water to help flush out her bladder.

Patient rotation limits evaluation of the cardiomediastinal contour, but there is cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. No site of focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia and there is no pleural effusion.  \n\nHEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territory infarction. The ventricles and sulci are prominent and are enlarged in size, consistent with age-related parenchymal involutional change. In addition, there is asymmetric enlargement of the extra-axial CSF space on the left. This may represent a combination of asymmetric parenchymal atrophy and possible chronic subdural hematoma or hygroma, although this differentiation is difficult with lack of remote prior studies.

Involutional change with enlargement of ventricles and sulci, and asymmetric enlargement of extra-axial CSF space on the left. \n\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAM:\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. These findings are consistent with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated atelectasis. Marked cardiomegaly is additionally noted. An 8-mm low-attenuation focus within the left lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst (2:21). Similarly, a 7-mm low-attenuation focus in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but also likely represents a simple cyst (2:26). The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Please note, moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites also limits detailed evaluation. The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and abdominal portions of the small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the largest of which is located at the upper pole of the right kidney and measures 5.3 cm in diameter (2:20). The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.

History is gathered from the patient's two daughters, as he is too obtunded to give a history.  Per his daughters, he had been experiencing increasing CP all week since being discharged from rehab.  Has had multiple episodes of chest pain that came on with both rest and exertion, as well as while sitting on the toilet trying to have BM. Associated with diaphoresis and radiation of pain to left arm. Episodes lasted less than an hour usually and were relieved with multiple doses of nitro.  He also was complaining of worsening shortness of breath, which became signficantly worse last night.  Has been sleeping sitting up in a chair, becomes dyspneic and has chest pain when lying flat.  Daughters also endorse PND and worsening lower extremity edema. \n\ufeff\nGiven all these symptoms, his daughters have called a few times this week, but thus far the patient had refused to go.  Today they mentioned his symptoms at a pre-op visit for CABG planning, and they were told to call their cardiologist, who recommended they bring him to the ER.  They brought him to hospital, where he was tachypneic and tachycardic, so he was started on BiPAP.  Nitro paste was applied, resulting in hypotension, so paste was removed.  Cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and ECG showed baseline LVH with \"strain\" pattern. Given that his providers were and he is scheduled to undergo CABG here next week, he was transferred to ED via med-evac flight.  While en route he started to not tolerate the BiPAP, was given ativan 2mg IV, and subsequently became obtunded. \nOn arrival to hospital, initial vitals were HR: 99, BP: 179/70, and \nhis GCS was 7, he was satting 90% on NRB.  He was switched back onto BiPAP given his belly breathing, poor breath sounds at bases with crackles. He was started low dose nitro gtt with drop in pressures again, so this was stopped.  No lasix was given in the ED.

These adverse effects may be increased if one has had previous (especially recent) radiation exposure to the same skin area. Radiation injury to the skin can take many forms, including an area of redness, blistering, hair loss, or ulceration. These effects may appear after a few weeks or even after several months. If an of these occur on the side and back of the torso (or elsewhere), please contact the Interventional Cardiology Section to arrange further evaluation.\n\nECG:non-ST-elevation", "file_path": "data/Finished/Acute Coronary Syndrome/UA/14512858-DS-5.json"}

She complained of mild mid-sternal to left shoulder pressure at peak exercise, which resolved almost completely by 5 minutes of recovery with the remaining discomfort only occuring with palpation. In the presence of RBBB on baseline ECG, there were no changes in ST segment or T wave morphology noted during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with one isolated PVC seen during exercise and one ventricular couplet seen in immediate recovery. The heart rate and blood pressure responses were mildly blunted (beta blockade). \n  \n___ CXR:\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n  \n___ ECHO bedside:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded - it appears that the inferior wall may be hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic examination with Doppler is recommended. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed), right ventricle is slightly larger.

He has been a lifelong heavy drinker and smoker, but he's been drinking far more than usual and at atypical times of day. He's also had erratic behavior including spending all his time naked, being incontinent of urine and sometimes stool, shouting sporadically and playing loud music, and other behavior that is very atypical for him. He was recently hospitalized for a rectal foreign body that was removed successfully. Due to concern for behavioral changes and rapidly progressive dementia, neurology was consulted. They suggested an extensive neurologic workup but the patient left AMA. He has since established with neurology but has also declined a workup there. \n\nHe was having a typical day, and drinking heavily during the day. His wife made him a sandwich and left the room briefly and returned when she heard gurgling sounds. She found him to have jerking movements of his extremities and not responding to her. She called EMS who arrived within minutes and found him to be pulseless VF and delivered a shock, regaining a pulse. He was intubated in the field. He received an amiodarone bolus. He was given 600mg aspirin PR. \n\nOn arrival, there is observed to be anterior ST elevations. Angiography showed 95% LM ostial stenosis, 90% LAD extending to mid-LAD and 90% stenosis at large diagonal. the circumflex has 80% mid stenosis. The RCA had minimal disease. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed using R femoral access. \n\nOn arrival for to the ICU, he was found to not be following commands and post-arrest was consulted who recommended targeted-temperature management and EEG.He is a gentleman with CAD (known occluded RCA with collaterals s/p PCI's (PTCA and stenting of ostial LCx and PTCA ostial RI c/b instent restenosis at ostium of LCx and restenosis of ramus branch s/p PTCA of LCx ostium and ramus ostium, HTN, HL, chronic low back pain and anxiety who presented to OSH with chest pain.

He underwent a nuclearstress test that demonstrated METs with chest pain symptoms. Normal myocardial perfusion study. LVEF 46&\". In addition, a TTE demonstrated \"LVEF 60-65%, normal RV, mild MR\".\n\nHe was seen that his chest pain was attributed to possible angina though this was deemed less likely given his negative stress testing. Given his risk factors and family history the patient, along with his cardiologist elected to pursue angiography. \n\nThe patient underwent elective coronary angiography which demonstrated a 90% proximal LAD lesion for which a 3.0x12 Xience (DES). He was loaded with ticagrelor and discharged the same day. \n\nThe patient was seen in the CDAC for abdominal discomfort that is exacerbated after eating food ever since he started taking his ticagrelor. He was instructed to start pantoprazole and to discontinue his ticagrelor. He was given a prescription for clopidogrel 75mg daily after a 300mg loading dose. \n\nHe had taken his morning dose of ticagrelor. He was instructed to hold his evening dose and load with clopidogrel 300mg the next morning. The patient went to his pharmacy that evening to pick up his prescription. The pharmacist said they did not have the 300mg loading dose available but that the patient should come back the next day to pick it up. The patient took clopidogrel 75mg the next morning with plans to  pick up his loading dose later in the day. \n\nHowever, before the patient could pick up with prescription, he had the sudden onset of sharp, mid-abdominal pain. This was without radiation, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. \n\nHis vitals on presentation were notable for T 98.2 HR 73 R 16 BP146/101 SpO2 99. His Chemistry panel was wnl. LFTs were notable for AST 20 ALT 38 AP 62 and Lipase 128. INR was 1.2 CBC was wnl.\n\nHe underwent a CT abd which showed evidence of mild pancreatitis. He was admitted for abdominal pain with concern for pancretitis.\n\nHis ECG on admission demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 with normal axis and intervals. There was TWI in V4-6 and STD I-II. \n\nThe next day, the patient reported sudden onset of dyspnea, nausea/vomiting and diaphoresis. An ECG was obtained which demonstrated sinus rhythm at a rate of 89 with STE V2-V5 and aVL with reciprocal changed in II and III. He was transferred out of concern for in-stent thrombosis.\n\nUpon arrival, he was taken directly to the cath lab where he underwent coronary angiography via the R radial artery. This demonstrated complete occlusion of the LAD for which he received POBA. \n\nHe was then transferred to the floor where he was complaining of mild dyspnea but improved abdominal pain. He has no fevers or chills. No chest pain or papliations. His ECG showed improved anteroseptal STEs.\n\nOf note, the patient has had an episode of pancreatitis that was thought to be possible due to biliary obstruction but  no stones were seen on EUS. Therefore the etiology was thought to  be from resolved choledocholithiasis vs. idiopathic.

He says his discomfort has been going on for a few weeks, and he has been attributing it to a musculoskeletal injury from working out. The pain subsided after working out at the gym, and he subsequently went to work. At some point later in the morning at work, he developed sudden onset dizziness, sweating, and chest pain that he described as \"knifelike\". He became so uncomfortable that he \"could not speak\". His wife, who works in the same office as him, called ___. He also had one episode of vomiting.\n\nHe was brought to cath lab where he had total occlusion of LAD. 3 DES (2.5mmx15mm, 3mmx15mm, 3.5mmx15mm) placed in LAD. There was no reflow which minimally responded to intracoronary agents. Given ongoing angina and poor flow in LAD, he was started on an IABP in addition to IV eptifibitide and IV heparin. Given 180 mcg of 325 mg, and 4000U heparin. Subsequently transferred here for further workup and management.\n\nVitals prior to transfer 138/77 w O2 sats 99% on 4L NC.\n\nOn arrival to the CCU, patient was having persistent chest pain and nausea. He was started on a nitro drip with little relief. His EKG showed worsening ST elevations, and the decision was made to bring him to the cath lab. In our Cath Lab his balloon pump was removed and replaced with an Impella via the right groin. His LVEDP went from ___ after balloon placement. Per verbal sign out from the Cath Lab, the stents placed earlier in the day appeared patent but there was residual disease distal to them. Ultimately 2 additional stents were placed in the LAD. Angiography of the LAD revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, occluded diagnoal branch likely due to pre-existing dissection, but no dissection in the LAD proper. \n\nHe also had another stent placed in his OM1 which was 95% occluded. Final angiography of the OM revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, and no dissection. He received about 1 L of IV fluid in the Cath Lab, as well as 210 cc of contrast.\n\nUpon return to the CCU, his Impella was noted to be properly placed on bedside ultrasound, and his chest pain had improved.\n\nLABS NOTABLE FOR: WBC 10.9 HGB 15.4 PLT GLC 126\n\nROS: Positive per HPI.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid anterior, lateral, and inferior walls and entire distal apex. hypokinesis of . There is severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments, with worse hypokinesis in the mid-level compared with the basal walls (LVEF = 15 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global dysfunction c/w CAD (3VD). Borderline right ventricular systolic function.\n\n___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION\nMultiple attempts were required for right radial arterial access. The Magic Torque wire could not be delivered into the proximalright subclavian artery past the right vertebral artery due toextreme tortuousity (most likely a 360 degree turn). Rightfemoral artery access was then obtained using ultrasound imagingguidance and a MicroPuncture kit on the attempt. The RIMA waspatent.\n\nThe heart appeared dilated with splayed coronary arteries widely separated. There was dense posterior mitral annular calcification.\n\nCoronary angiography: CO-dominant\n  LMCA: The LMCA was short with distal funneling to 25%.\n  LAD: The proximal LAD was heavily calcified. The mid LAD was occluded after small D1, D2 and D3 branches. There was faint reconstitution of the mid-distal LAD via left-to-left collaterals.\n  LCX: The AV groove CX was large in caliber with mild plaquing throughout. There were 2 short OM1 and OM2 branches with no obvious perfusion of the high lateral wall (raising the possibility of an occluded ramus intermedius branch). The major OM3/LPL1 had an origin tubular 70% stenosis. LPL2 was subtotally occluded proximally and reconstituted via left-to-left collaterals with distal moderate disease at a bifurcation and TIM1 flow. The distal CX supplied collaterals to the diseased RPDA and RCA with retrograde filling up to the mid RCA. The LPDA was somewhat tortuous.\n  RCA: The RCA was occluded proximally past the conus and SA nodal branches. There was no reconstitution of the native RCA beyond.\n\n___ CXR \nThere is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. The aorta is unfolded.  There is possible minimal upper zone re-distribution, but no other evidence of CHF.  No focal infiltrate or effusion.  No pneumothorax detected. Increased opacity adjacent to the left cardiac apex/left costophrenic angle most likely is related to a cardiac fat pad and/or overlying soft tissues. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.  No acute pulmonary process identified.", "file_path": "data/Finished/Acute Coronary Syndrome/NSTEMI/12054012-DS-14.json"}

The patient was infused 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 mins. No arm, chest, neck or back discomfort noted during the study. There were no ST segment changes during the infusion or during recovery. The rhythm was sinus with two runs of PSVT (one 3 beat during infusion and the second ___ beat run in recovery), two PACs and single atrial couplet. Appropriate hemodynamic response to infusion and recovery. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg IV aminophylline.\n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve leaflets are not well visualized. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function. Well seated aortic valve bioprosthesisleft with increased transaortic gradients, likely secondary to incrased flow from high output versus patient/prosthesis mismatch (similar mean gradient reported on post-op TEE. True prosthesis stenosis is less likely given the early peaking contour of the transaortic jet velocity (AT < 100 ms), although cannot completely exclude.", "file_path": "data/Finished/Atrial Fibrillation/Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/13492756-DS-4.json"}

He exercised for only 2.5 minutes of protocol METs) and requested to stop due to difficulty breathing and an \"uncomfortable feeling\" in his chest. This represents a limited functional capacity for his age. He complained of chest discomfort with breathing at peak exercise, which resolved immediately with rest. There was no significant ST segment changes noted with exercise or recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent PVC's, sustained ventricular bigemeny and occasional ventricular couplets all occurring at low levels of exercise and resolved in immediate recovery. There was hypertension at rest with an exaggerated blood pressure response to low level exercise. The heart rate responded appropriately to the level of exercise performed. IMPRESSION: No significant ST segment changes noted. Sudden onset of ventricular ectopy at low workloads accompanied by difficult breathing. Limited functional capacity demonstrated. \n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet (late systolic jet) of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCardiac Catheterization ___:\n1. Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease. The vessels were ectatic. The LAD had a short intramyocardial segment in the \nmid-vessel which induced a 40% stenosis. \n2. Resting hemodynamics revealed slightly normal left heart filling \npresssures and slightly elevated right heart filling pressures. The RVEDP and LVEDP were equal at 14mmHg. There was mild pulmonary hypertension with diastolic pressures equal to LVEDP and RVEDP. The pattern was consistent with restrictive/constrictive physiology. \n3.

Hx obtained from pt and OSH records. \n\nPatient was recently admitted to  section 35 from facility for evaluation of seizure like activity. He was being treated at this facility for poly substance abuse including heroin, benzos and opiates on Methadone 100 mg day. Per OSH documentation, benzos Xanax per day) were quickly weaned off at facility and may have prompted these events. At OSH pt was noted to have an episodes of tonic clonic movement and convulsions with urinary incontinence. He was managed in ICU out of concern for benzo withdrawal and was treated with high dose benzos. He was reportedly evaluated by neurology and thought that may be pseudo seizures (pt himself feels that these are pseudoseizures) started on Keppra 500 mg BID with no effect. He continued to have episodes per day. Routine EEG was performed but there was no neurologist to read due to neurologist there being on vacation until end. He was then transferred as a direct admission for further evaluation. \n\nOf note, en route he had an episode where he suddenly stopped talking to EMS and his whole body began to shake violently. EMS brought him to the ED where he continued to violently shake all his extremities non rhythmically. He was given 2mg Ativan x1 without improvement. ED resident put saline in his eyes which stopped the episode immediately. Entire episode lasted circa 15 minutes per report w/ postictal drowsiness.\n\nPer OSH documentation, pt has hx of \"partial complex seizure disorder\" for which he had previously been taking Lamictal and Lyrica, now on Tegretol. However, \n\nHet states that he first developed these type of events when he was 11 years old (at that time with aura of electrical activity moving up his body), at that time being started on Phenobarbital by his family doctor. He continued on this medication until he was 16 years old when his doctor left town and he could no longer obtain. He states that his seizures returned but evolved into more myoclonic activity (imitates in bed as a whole body jerk). Around this time he began to buy benzodiazepines  on the street as preventative therapy, particularly when he felt that a seizure may be coming on. He thinks that he used this medication 1/month w/ control of his episodes. At the same time he also began to engage in heroin use. This behavior continued for some years until college when he began to have breakthrough events. Soon after that he was working in where  he was able to obtain Phenobarbital with cessation of his episodes. However, they returned when he came back to US and was unable to receive medication. He had a similar experience while working in the following year. In the last years he quit heroin but began to take Valium daily. Because he continued to be dependent on this medication, he presented to detox when he had seizure like activity and was sent.\n\n[Past Medical History / Allergies]:\n+Seizure disorder\n+Mood d/o\n+polysubstance  abuse\n\n[Review of Systems]:\nNC\n\n[Physical Exam]:\n- General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.\n- HEENT: NC/AT\n- Neck: Supple\n- Pulmonary: no increased WOB\n- Cardiac: well perfused \n- Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended\n- Extremities: no edema, pulses palpated\n- Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.\n\nNeurologic:\n\n-Mental Status: Appears very drowsy, oriented to person place and year.

Per the patient's husband, her seizure frequency was decreased from her prior presentation with most events occuring as staring into space, only some of which secondarily generalize to tonic asymmetric posture with either eyes rolled back or clenched tightly and non-rhythmic, asymmetric jerking or posturing lasting for <2 minutes per episode.  This morning, the patient was in a continuing education seminar at which time, she was witnessed to have two of the asymmetric posturing and non-rhythmic tremor events for which EMS was activated.  Per the run report of the patient to ED, she had two further events with very little post-ictal confusion or fatigue, rather only some quieter speech.  She had another event while in transport, for which she received 1mg ativan with good effect.  While in the ED she also had two events which were treated with 1mg ativan, and then 2mg ativan, roughly apart of each other.\n\nIn the ED with Neurology present, the patient had two further episodes of seizure which were not treated with any intervention. The semiology of these included the patient closing her eyes and becoming unresponsive, then her eyes became tightly closed with subsequent back arching and asymmetric tonic posturing of her upper and lower extremities. The patient subsequently began having nonrhythmic convulsive activity and was able to have alternating upper and lower extremity movement with a turn from her right to her left lateral decubitus.  This event lasted for approximately 90 seconds with resolution. No postictal confusion or frank fatigue as noted, nor was any paralysis experienced.  During his advanced the patient was able to pull off her EKG leads.\n\nRecently, she was admitted for characterization of these events on video EEG monitoring.  Multiple events were captured with no clear EEG correlate but there was some temporal slowing after a few of the events which raised concern for deep seizures that weren't being captured by surface electrodes. SPECT was performed at which time she was placed back on VPA 500mg BID and ZNS 100mg BID, with a plan to increase the zonisamide slowely over the next 2 weeks. \n\nNo recent illness, trauma, or other exposures were noted.

She was admitted to the epilepsy service in early with her typical events and was found to be in nonconvulsiveabsence status.  She was started on zonisamide but becamelethargic at 200 mg daily so was decreased to 100 mg daily andslowly titrated up back to current dose of 200 mg daily. (lethargy was also in context of ativan taper).  She had been on keppra 1250 mg bid which was slowly tapered off over the past several weeks.  She has also tried dilantin in the past.

Mastoid air cells are clear. \n\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ___\nPatchy consolidation is seen within the left lower lobe of the lung consistent with pneumonia. A small pleural effusion is also seen on the left. In addition, there is dependent atelectasis in the right lung. The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion is noted. \n  \nThe liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra- abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits. There are tiny non- obstructing renal stones seen within the kidneys bilaterally. In addition, multiple well-circumscribed hypodense areas are seen within the kidneys bilaterally, most consistent with cysts, unchanged. There is diffuse calcification of the abdominal aorta and the splenic, celiac, common hepatic, and iliac arteries. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is seen. High-density material is seen within the dependent portion of the second segment of the duodenum, which may be due to recent ingestion of high density material (ie medication or contrast).\n\nSputum with MRSA bronch: sensitive to Clinda, Tetracycline, Bactrim, Vancomycin, (Resistant to Erythro, Oxacillin, Penicillin, Cefazolin).", "file_path": "data/Finished/Pneumonia/Bacterial Pneumonia/19313611-DS-17.json"}

She reports going to bed yesterday evening in her usual state of health. On waking up this morning at 08:30, she noticed \"tingling\" paresthesiae over the sole of her right foot on rising from bed. She describes the sensation as 'pins and needles' similar to her foot falling asleep, but had not woken up in an unusual position or rested her leg on any hard surface overnight. Her paresthesiae did not resolve over the next few minutes, prompting her to activate EMS. There, she underwent a non-contrast head CT that was noted to have a few new linear areas of hyperdensity in the area of a prior parietal infarct; as a subdural hematoma could not beexcluded per report, she was transferred for Neurosurgical evaluation. Notably, her symptoms resolved while obtaining her imaging, lasting approximately two hours in total. She denies a similar recent history of paresthesiae, and denies headache, back pain, leg pain, focal weakness, vision change, speech disturbance, or gait disturbance associated with her most recent episode.

She is currently enrolled in a clinical trial (randomized and started on study medication . She has a h/o RRMS diagnosed first with an episode of L-sided optic neuritis. However, retrospectively she had an episode of decreased visual acuity and difficulty walking and drove herself to the hospital only to fall out of the car semiconcious at the hospital doors. She has not had a flare years. In total she has had 4 clinical episodes during this time, averaging approximately every 18 months. She describes her episodes as beginning with decreased appetite and weight loss progressing to difficulty walking and blurried vision. During her episodes she becomes wheelchair bound, although between episodes she describes her walking as completely normal and feels that she even walks faster than most people. Her vision in her L eye recovered after her first two flares, but she is now only able to see shadows out of her L eye. She reports that flares always happen in the winter. Since her diagnosis Ms. has been taking Avonex full dose (30 mcg weekly). Her medication was changed to Tysabri and she stopped the Avonex. \n.\nThis particular flare began approximately weeks prior to admission when Ms. noticed that her walking was slowing. She also began noticing an intense burning pain extending from below her breasts symmetrically down her torso and both of her legs to the bottom of her feet. She was taking Aleve twice a day with improvement in the pain. This pain is a new symptom that she has not had with previous flares - at least not to this extent. She noticed that her knees felt week two days prior to admission and on the day prior to admission she was wheelchair bound. At the time of presentation she reports that she is able to walk a bit better with her walker. \n.\nOf note, Ms. reports that her best friend died of colon cancer 5 weeks prior to presentation. In addition, Ms. one episode of vertigo which lasted a full day one month prior to admission for which she was not evaluated. She also has noticed increased urinary urgency, whichshe believes is due to drinking more fluids and difficulty getting to the bathroom in the last few days. She has not had a bowel movement in 4 days, which is not normal for her. At baseline, she has electrical sensations in the base of her head and neck at baseline worse with neck flexion (Lhermitte's phenomenon). She describes generalized painful electrical sensations in her lower extremities bilaterally.

She noted a pins and needles sensation over her abm. This improved when she took Benadryl. Gradually over the week the sensation persisted and became stronger. She then also felt a sensation of heaviness or weight on her abm \"like a rock sitting there\". She went to the ED yesterday and was discharged. Today she had persistent symptoms and decided to come to urgent care where she was referred to the hospital. \n\nShe has had similar symptom about 1 years ago. At that time she had gradually progressive numbness over her L thumb. This spread up her entire L arm and may have involved her L face. She was evaluated at the time with MRI and LP. She recalls that the MRI of the brain and spinal cord showed lesions but that the LP was normal. She recalls also being tested for Lyme which was negative. She was never treated with steroids or IMD. Her symptoms gradually resolved over several months. \n\nShe was referred to a neurologist and had serial MRI's over 1 years.

Upon evaluation by Dr. was felt that she could be experiencing another flare despite her pregnancy, and an admission was recommended, however patient decided to leave AMA. \n\ufeff\nShe states that a few hours after finishing her first infusion, she started to develop a sensation of her left side feeling \"off\" which she has difficulty describing, but endorses is difficulty functioning with her left hand, for example she is missing keys while texting on her phone. She is also experiencing tingling in the hand. She also endorses that her coordination and balance are \"off\", and that she has to hold on to walls while ambulating. This is new for her. She also had a sensation that her left eye \"wants to be closed\", but she denies any vision loss, blurred vision, or double vision.\n\ufeff\nInitially she attributed these symptoms to a side effect of solumedrol, however this morning she continued to experience them, and concerned, she called the on-call neurology resident who advised her to come to the ED for evaluation. She is not certain that the symptoms are getting worse, but they are certainly not improving.\n\ufeff\n\n[Past Medical History / Allergies]:\n+ Asthma \n+ Lactose intolerance\n+ Ovarian cyst s/p removal\n+ Back Pain \n+ Dysmenorrhea \n+ Lymphocytic colitis, controlled constipation  \n+ IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)  \n+ Postpartum hemorrhage\n\n[Review of Systems]:\n3 aunts with lupus uncle: DVT, Maternal grandmother: \"epileptic\"\n\n[Physical Exam]:\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\nGeneral: awake, cooperative, NAD.\nHEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx\nNeck: supple, no nuchal rigidity\nPulmonary: breathing comfortably on room air\nCardiac: RRR, nl\nAbdomen: soft, NT/ND\nExtremities: warm, well perfused\nSkin: no rashes or lesions noted\n\ufeff\nNeurologic:\n\ufeff\n-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3.

He noticed DOE, particularly when walking to work, which he was able to do with difficulty prior. He is at baseline very athletic. He also noticed intermittent dizziness and lightheadedness with standing, intermittent cramping abdominal pain and a 20lbs unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports his appetite is still at baseline but has been limited by his abdominal pain. He endorses  nausea at the time of his URI. Given these symptoms he saw his PCP. His PCP ran series of lab notable for TSH 0.21, AlP 76, AST 48, K 5.3. He had a RAIU+S, which showed a homogenous gland with uptake at the upper limit of normal. He was then referred to endocrine for further evaluation.\n  \nHe was seen in clinic the day of admission and was initally thought to have resolving thyroditis, and was sent to have several labs checked. Labs from clinic were notable for elevated TSH of 22, low T4 at 3.6 with normal T 3,hyponatermia to 121, hyperkalemia to 5.8, hyperphosphatemia to 5.6, low pm cortisol of 0.7.

In the meantime, her PCP reportedly told her to stop taking her losartan given dizziness. \n\ufeff\nShe saw Dr.  who recommended cardiac monitoring because she had not had this done, encouraged aspirin compliance and recommended stopping memantine given ongoing dizziness. \n\ufeff\nShe then presented to the ED for ongoing dizziness and anxiety at which time she had unremarkable labs, utox, stox. Psych consulted and recommended melatonin and trazodone. Neurology was not consulted. She was scheduled to follow-up with her PCP for evaluation of her dizziness. \n\ufeff\nshe has had continued dizziness which is worsened by trazodone. She has had ongoing insomnia and has not been able to sleep except for a few hours at time. She reports a lot of anxiety regarding sleep and her health problems. \"Please do not give me more bad news\". She reports that all of her problems started when she learned her daughter was moving back to japan five months ago and \"I have cried everyday since then\". \n\ufeff\nSeveral days ago she felt that her aspirin was making he extremely anxious so she stopped taking it (has not taken. She went to bed around 11p last night and then woke up at 3:00A feeling very anxious (this is typical for her). However, she noticed that in addition to her usual dizziness, she felt a sensation of spinning and it looked like the pictures on the wall were moving. She had no speech problems, weakness or sensory problems but did feel off balance when walking. She did not fall to a particular side but did feel she had to grab onto the chair to walk. \n\ufeff\nOtherwise, she has had several days of poor appetite. She was also constipated for several days and then took Mylanta yesterday which subsequently made her have two episodes of emesis. She denies fevers, chills, dysuria, abdominal pain, cough or other infectious symptoms. \n \nROS: On further neurologic review of systems, patient has chronic hearing loss (left ear). She denies headaches. Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech. Denies dysarthria, or dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia. Denies loss of sensation.
